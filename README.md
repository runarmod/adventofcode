# Advent of Code

This repository contains of all of my code from [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/). Most is undone, and will get updated as I complete more.

This repository contains a setup file, which will initiate a work-directory with a template, in addition to downloading the input using a cookie found in [.env](https://github.com/runarmod/adventofcode/blob/main/.env.example).
