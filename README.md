# Advent of Code

This repository contains of all of my code from [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/). Most is undone, and will get update as I complete more.
The majority (I think maybe all) of the code is written a long time after the release of the puzzles.
Though I will try now in 2022 to do as many problems the day of release.

This repository contains a setup file, which will initiate a work-directory with a template, in addition to downloading the input from a (ignored) cookie.py file.
